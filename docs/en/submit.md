# Submission

> [!CAUTION]  
> Please do not create a pull request on the main project or fork it! Your code won't be private!  

Of course, you still need to send us your solution. Depending on how you have set up the project, there are several ways to send us the source code.

- Set up as [GitHub Template](#template)
- Set up as [Git Clone / Import](#clone)
- Set up as [ZIP-Export](#zip)

## GitHub template

Before your code appears on GitHub, you need to upload it using Git. To do this, open a console (e.g. `cmd`) in the source folder and run the following commands:

```bash
git add . # Marks all files for upload
git commit -m "Add files" # You can also enter a different message here
git push -u origin dev # Upload files to the repository
```

After that, you just need to make a few settings in the repository on GitHub to submit your code.

To make sure your pull request doesn't get lost, please email us a link to the pull request.

## Git clone / import

Create a pull request from `dev` to `main` in your repository and add us as a reviewer (for repositories on GitHub, see the [GitHub template](#template)). If you have forgotten to work on `dev`, send us a link with the comparison (compare / diff). Alternatively, you can send us your project as a ZIP file.

<a name="zip"></a>

## ZIP export

If you downloaded the code as a ZIP file, you can put your source code back into a ZIP file and email it to us.
